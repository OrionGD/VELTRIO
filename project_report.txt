# VELTRIO - AI Real-time Translation & Sentiment Analysis Project Report

## 1. Executive Summary
VELTRIO is a sophisticated web application designed to bridge communication gaps by providing real-time language translation, sentiment analysis, and interactive AI voice conversations. Leveraging the Google GenAI SDK and Gemini models, the application offers users deep insights into both the literal meaning and emotional context of communication.

## 2. Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React 19
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **AI Integration**: Google GenAI SDK (`@google/genai`)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Audio Processing**: Web Audio API

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1. Smart Translator (`TranslatorView`)
- **Multi-modal Input**: Supports both text typing and speech input via the browser's SpeechRecognition API.
- **Intelligent Defaults**: Automatically detects and defaults to the user's browser language for speech input.
- **Real-time Translation**: Utilizes the `gemini-2.5-flash` model for high-speed, accurate text translation.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes input text to categorize emotion (Positive, Negative, Neutral) and provides contextual explanations.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Integrated speech synthesis to read aloud translated text in the target language.
- **History Management**: Persists translation history locally, allowing users to review past interactions.

### 3.2. Live Conversation (`ConversationView`)
- **Bidirectional Voice Chat**: Implements the Gemini Live API for low-latency, natural voice-to-voice interaction.
- **Custom Audio Pipeline**: 
  - Raw PCM audio streaming (16kHz input / 24kHz output).
  - Manual Base64 encoding/decoding and audio buffering.
- **Real-time Transcription**: Displays live transcripts of the user's input and the AI's response.

### 3.3. User Experience
- **Landing Page**: An engaging, visually appealing entry point highlighting core value propositions.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS for seamless usage across devices.
- **Visual Feedback**: comprehensive loading states, recording indicators, and sentiment visualizations.

## 4. Architecture & Implementation Details

### 4.1. Core Services
- **`services/geminiService.ts`**: 
  - Implements a Singleton pattern for the `GoogleGenAI` client to ensure efficient resource management.
  - Handles structured JSON output generation for sentiment analysis validation.
- **`utils/audio.ts`**:
  - Contains low-level utilities for audio data manipulation.
  - Handles conversion between Float32 (Web Audio) and Int16 (PCM) formats required by the Gemini API.

### 4.2. Component Logic
- **Translator Logic**:
  - Uses debouncing to minimize API calls while typing.
  - Manages `SpeechRecognition` state, including dynamic language switching during recording sessions.
- **Conversation Logic**:
  - Manages a complex state machine (idle -> connecting -> active -> error).
  - Uses `ScriptProcessorNode` for capturing microphone input stream.
  - Handles audio playback queueing to ensure gapless AI responses.

## 5. File Structure
- `index.tsx` / `App.tsx`: Entry point and routing logic.
- `components/`: UI components (Views, Icons, Displays).
- `services/`: API interaction logic.
- `utils/`: Helper functions for data processing.
- `types.ts` / `constants.ts`: Shared type definitions and configuration constants.

## 6. Future Roadmap
- **Video Integration**: Expanding the Live API implementation to support video stream input.
- **Offline Capabilities**: PWA support for basic functionality without internet access.
- **User Accounts**: Cloud synchronization of translation history.
